# 100-DAYS-OF-RTL
Salutations to my fellow VLSI enthusiasts! I'm Kanna Akshay, a fan of VLSI who designs RTL in Verilog HDL using Intel's Quartus Prime 17.1 and ModelSim for simulation and synthesis. Come along for the ride as 100 days are devoted to perfecting RTL design and developing Verilog abilities.
